title: Someone starred my GitHub repo

A few months ago, I built a little script that downloads album covers from LastFM and saves them inside music folders in local file system.

I built it as an exercise while learning the basics of Golang and the end result is nothing too fancy. I named it _Mukhachitram_ (it means portrait/frontcover in my native language [Telugu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telugu_language)) and uploaded it [here](https://github.com/akkisagiraju/mukhachitram).

The reason I am writing this post is - someone starred that repo. It was the first time one of my repos received a star from someone I did not personally know. It made my day better knowing that a total stranger found the thing I built in my free time to be useful and worthy of starring.

I am committed to building more things publicly and I hope more people will find them useful. This is where you can find them: https://github.com/akkisagiraju

Thank you for reading. That is all.
