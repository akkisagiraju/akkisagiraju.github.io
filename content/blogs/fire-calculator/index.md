title: I made a FIRE calculator

I’ve always liked the idea of financial independence. The thought of not being forced to work just to make ends meet has always felt... right.

Over the years, I’ve come across the FIRE movement - Financial Independence, Retire Early. It’s not a one-size-fits-all path, but the principles behind it make sense to me. Save more. Spend less. Invest the difference. Watch the compounding magic do its thing.

So I built a simple calculator for it.

You can try it here: [FIRE Calculator](https://fire.mimirmind.tech)

It helps you figure out how much money you’ll need to retire early and how long it might take you to get there. You plug in your savings, expenses, investment returns, and the calculator tells you your timeline to freedom.

No signup. No fluff. Just numbers.

This is the kind of thing I would’ve liked to use when I first heard about FIRE; something quick and clean that gives a rough idea of the road ahead.

If you’re already on this journey or just curious about it, I hope you find it useful. And if not, maybe it sparks something.

Let me know what you think. I’d love to improve it.
