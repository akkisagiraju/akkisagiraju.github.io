If you aren't sure where PostCSS plugins are configured for the tools you're using, you'll want to refer to the documentation for those tools to learn where this should go. A search for "configure postcss {my tool}" will get you the answer pretty fast, too.

If you're already familiar with PostCSS you probably know what you need to do, if not refer to the documentation for the tool you are using.

For simple projects or just giving Tailwind a spin, you can use the Tailwind CLI tool to generate your CSS without configuring PostCSS or even installing Tailwind as a dependency if you don't want to.

## Using something

Before using the CDN build, please note that many of the features that make Tailwind CSS great are not available without incorporating Tailwind into your build process.
