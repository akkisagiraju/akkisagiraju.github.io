I bought it in 2018 and it had served me well in all those years.</p>\n<p class=\"text-md mt-2 mb-8 lg:text-lg dark:text-gray-200\">I started looking for options. My main requirement was clean software experience. That eliminated a lot of choices in the Android world and iOS was my last option. But I almost pulled the trigger on an iPhone 13 before I realized my current phone was still fast enough to do almost everything I need it for, which are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Web browsing</li>\n<li>Texting/calling a limited number of people</li>\n<li>Checking email and calendar</li>\n<li>Tracking my expenses</li>\n<li>Listening to music on Spotify</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"text-md mt-2 mb-8 lg:text-lg dark:text-gray-200\">I do not need the latest and greatest hardware with an ultra fast processor and shiny new high refresh rate display for my use cases.</p>\n<p class=\"text-md mt-2 mb-8 lg:text-lg dark:text-gray-200\">I wanted to keep using the same phone. So, I got its battery replaced at an authorized service centre. It costed me INR 1600 ($20) and greatly improved its battery life. I also decided to install a custom ROM for leaner Android experience because OxygenOS is not the same anymore since OxygenOS 11 and OnePlus had already ended software support for OnePlus 6 which means it would no longer receive security updates.</p>\n<p class=\"text-md mt-2 mb-8 lg:text-lg dark:text-gray-200\">LineageOS was my obvious choice because I was a CyanogenMod user back in the day and it's usually the most stable of all the after market Android ROMs.</p>\n<p class=\"text-md mt-2 mb-8 lg:text-lg dark:text-gray-200\"><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 900px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/3049446e9565cc67e5782a6c02cc3767/791cc/screenshots.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 66.22222222222223%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"screenshots\"\n        title=\"screenshots\"\n        src=\"/static/3049446e9565cc67e5782a6c02cc3767/e7448/screenshots.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/3049446e9565cc67e5782a6c02cc3767/0608e/screenshots.png 225w,\n/static/3049446e9565cc67e5782a6c02cc3767/31401/screenshots.png 450w,\n/static/3049446e9565cc67e5782a6c02cc3767/e7448/screenshots.png 900w,\n/static/3049446e9565cc67e5782a6c02cc3767/9ac8b/screenshots.png 1350w,\n/static/3049446e9565cc67e5782a6c02cc3767/28bdc/screenshots.png 1800w,\n/static/3049446e9565cc67e5782a6c02cc3767/791cc/screenshots.png 2889w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p class=\"text-md mt-2 mb-8 lg:text-lg dark:text-gray-200\">The installation process wasn't as simple as I thought it would be. But it was not hard either. I had to unlock the bootloader, install a custom recovery (I went with TWRP), install the latest <a href=\"https://download.lineageos.org/enchilada\">LineageOS 19 build</a>, a <a href=\"https://sourceforge.net/projects/nikgapps/files/Releases/NikGapps-SL/01-May-2022/\">bare minimum Gapps package</a> for Android 12L, and finally <a href=\"https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk\">Magisk</a> to pass SafetyNet test and to make my banking apps work by hiding root access.</p>\n<p class=\"text-md mt-2 mb-8 lg:text-lg dark:text-gray-200\">That's it. My phone feels and functions as fast as the day I bought it and I do not have to think about buying a new phone anytime soon.</p>","excerpt":"Earlier this year, I felt I needed to upgrade my phone (OnePlus 6) mainly due to its degraded battery and the performance hit that caused.
