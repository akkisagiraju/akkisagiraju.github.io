Instead of getting it repaired, I retired it and bought a new inexpensive phone. That turned out to be problematic. I finally went with the OnePlus 9 which was on a sale. It's got good hardware but Oxygen OS isn't the same anymore, so I slapped LineageOS 19 on it and it's perfect now.</p>\n<p class=\"text-md mt-2 mb-8 lg:text-lg dark:text-gray-200\">I left home after a long time since the pandemic began, for a two week stay in Bangalore.</p>\n<p class=\"text-md mt-2 mb-8 lg:text-lg dark:text-gray-200\">It was my first time in Bangalore. I got to meet folks from work and spent the first week working in-person at the office. Despite Bangalore's infamous traffic woes, my daily commute hadn't been a problem as I stayed at a place close to the office. But the hightlight of the trip was spending time with a dear one of mine.</p>\n<p class=\"text-md mt-2 mb-8 lg:text-lg dark:text-gray-200\">I also started enjoying working with Django. I have mostly been a frontend engineer so far and writing Python code is more pleasant than I thought.</p>\n<p class=\"text-md mt-2 mb-8 lg:text-lg dark:text-gray-200\">It was in this June I had gone out the most this year, both with friends back in my hometown and in Bangalore. I am glad for that.</p>","excerpt":"A personal review of what happened in June 2022.
