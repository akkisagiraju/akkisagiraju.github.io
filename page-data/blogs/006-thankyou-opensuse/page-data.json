As a software developer and an enthusiast, I also wanted a rolling release distro to be on the bleeding edge. I narrowed my options to these three:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Arch Linux</li>\n<li>Manjaro (based on Arch with simpler installation process)</li>\n<li>openSUSE Tumbleweed</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"text-md mt-2 mb-8 lg:text-lg dark:text-gray-200\">I must say I didn't want to go through the installation of Arch by myself and that was the only reason why Manjaro made it to my list. Browsing through reddit and a few forums, I noticed people who use openSUSE Tumbleweed sweared by it and claimed it was the most stable rolling release that was less prone to stuff breaking. I know that's a self contradictory statement but I understand now.</p>\n<p class=\"text-md mt-2 mb-8 lg:text-lg dark:text-gray-200\">Over the past three years, I've been using openSUSE Tumbleweed and I am glad to say it ended my nasty habit of distro hopping. Here are the things I like about it the most:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">zypper</code> - Tumbleweed's package manager is a pleasure to use</li>\n<li>Comes with Btrfs by default. Snapper, a tool for managing btrfs sanpshots saved me a lot of headache once when an Nvidia driver update broke Electron apps once. Rolling back to a previous snapshot is as simple as <code class=\"language-text\">snapper rollback</code></li>\n<li>Rock solid OBS and openQA systems</li>\n<li>Never had any app or service crash on me</li>\n<li>First class support for KDE (my DE of choice)</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"text-md mt-2 mb-8 lg:text-lg dark:text-gray-200\">However, it wasn't a complete smooth sailing in the beginning. The default software repo had (still has) only open source software but after adding <a href=\"https://en.opensuse.org/Additional_package_repositories\">Packman</a>, I was able to install non-OSS like proprietory Nvidia drivers to use my RTX 3060 Ti to its full potential while gaming. A stricter firewall rules can also be offputting for some users. I had to modify a few rules just to setup KDE Connect and add an old printer I have. My other gripe is that some important software packages are differently than in other popular distros. This makes finding the exact package I need a little difficult but not impossible.</p>\n<p class=\"text-md mt-2 mb-8 lg:text-lg dark:text-gray-200\">But at the end of the day, Tumbleweed made my life easier by just letting me focus on what I do instead of fiddling with the OS. Thank you openSUSE for that.</p>","excerpt":"I'm writing this blog post to show my appreciation for openSUSE.
